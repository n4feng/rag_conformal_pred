This is particularly relevant in cases of depression where amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, is directly indicated.\n   - Both drugs showed improvement in patients when assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, with no significant differences in the overall effectiveness between the two groups.\n\n2. **Side Effects**:\n   - Alprazolam, a benzodiazepine primarily used for anxiety disorders, tends to have fewer side effects compared to amitriptyline. Notably, patients on alprazolam reported a lower incidence of dry mouth, light-headedness, tremor, and tachycardia.\n   - Overall, considerably fewer side effects were reported by patients receiving alprazolam than those taking amitriptyline.\n\n3. **Dosage**:\n   - The mean final dose of alprazolam was about 3.05 mg, whereas for amitriptyline it was 130 mg, reflecting their different dosing requirements due to the nature of the drugs.\n\n4. **Subgroup Analysis**:\n   - Certain subgroups of patients, such as those with depression accompanied by retardation, no precipitating factors, or low levels of anxiety, responded better to amitriptyline.\n\nIn summary, while amitriptyline may be more effective for some specific conditions, particularly certain types of depression, alprazolam generally has a more favorable side effect profile.
