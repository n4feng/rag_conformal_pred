K. Ralli\". Noted for her medical work and political standing, Ecaterina was nevertheless labeled an enemy of the Soviet people, arrested and killed during the Great Purge of the late 1930s. As an author, Zamfir Arbore was somewhat tolerated in the Soviet Union and its Moldavian SSR, created in 1940 by the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia. In the late 1940s, his name was included on a long list of authors officially banned by the Soviet censorship apparatus. However, in later years he was officially quoted and praised, one of the few exceptions to the rule which put limits on the popularization of Romanian literature (unlike Stere, whose work were still banned).\n' metadata={'source': 'Zamfir Arbore', 'file_path': '../index_store/factscore/title_text_map_factscore.txt'}"], [1218, "page_content='Zamfir Arbore: In Romania, Arbore was survived by daughter Nina (d. 1942).

The Arbores' patriarch was being rediscovered as a scholar, in particular after the 1960s liberalization (when Ecaterina was posthumously rehabilitated). Communist censorship however intervened in his various republished texts, cutting out all remarks which could seem Russophobic, keeping his political writings hidden from public view while allowing some exposure to his geography tracts. Among the anti-communist Romanian diaspora, genealogist Mihai Dim. Sturdza completed a more thorough account of Arbore's career, which covered the controversial aspects and was published in Sturdza's dictionary \"Familiile boiere\u0219ti din Moldova \u0219i \u021aara Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103\" (\"Boyar Families of Wallachia and Moldavia\").

During the 1960s, the exiled journalist Pamfil \u0218eicaru also included ample references to Arbore's anti-Russian texts in his own anti-communist propaganda works. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Arbore's name resurfaced in a nationalist conspiracy theory, which claims that Mihai Eminescu's descent into mental illness was staged by his more conservative political rivals. According to this interpretation, the involuntary commitment of Eminescu in summer 1883 was set to coincide with the expulsion of his friend Arbore.\n' metadata={'source': 'Zamfir Arbore', 'file_path': '../index_store/factscore/title_text_map_factscore.txt'}"], [1220, "page_content='Zamfir Arbore: Section::::Legacy.:In Moldova and abroad.\n' metadata={'source': 'Zamfir Arbore', 'file_path': '../index_store/factscore/title_text_map_factscore.txt'}"], [1221, "page_content='Zamfir Arbore: Arbore's works were reprinted in Moldova, the independent post-Soviet republic comprising the bulk of historical Bessarabia.
