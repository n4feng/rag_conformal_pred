Since bacterial ribosomes differ from human ribosomes, these antibiotics can selectively inhibit bacterial protein synthesis without affecting human cells.\n\n4. **DNA Replication Inhibition**: Some antibiotics target the enzymes involved in bacterial DNA replication, preventing the bacteria from multiplying.\n\nBy targeting these bacterial-specific structures and functions, antibiotics can kill or inhibit bacteria without harming human cells.", "claims": [{"subclaim": " Certain antibiotics can dissolve the membranes of bacterial cells", "similarity-score": 0.3404692559480667, "annotation": "S"}, {"subclaim": " Antibiotics can kill or inhibit bacteria without harming human cells", "similarity-score": 0.31767193443775177, "annotation": "S"}, {"subclaim": " Antibiotics can interfere with the machinery bacteria use to build proteins", "similarity-score": 0.31507127391099926, "annotation": "S"}, {"subclaim": "Antibiotics kill bacteria by targeting structures or functions specific to bacterial cells", "similarity-score": 0.31494240992069245, "annotation": "S"}, {"subclaim": " Antibiotics are found to affect human cells", "similarity-score": 0.3129055433571339, "annotation": "S"}, {"subclaim": " Some antibiotics prevent bacteria from building their cell walls", "similarity-score": 0.3118281760215759, "annotation": "S"}, {"subclaim": " Human cell membranes remain intact when affected by certain antibiotics", "similarity-score": 0.3002634829223156, "annotation": "S"}, {"subclaim": " Some antibiotics target enzymes involved in bacterial DNA replication", "similarity-score": 0.28950642147660255, "annotation": "S"}, {"subclaim": " Antibiotics selectively inhibit bacterial protein synthesis", "similarity-score": 0.28550897547006604, "annotation": "S"}, {"subclaim": " Antibiotics prevent bacteria from multiplying", "similarity-score": 0.28084822000265125, "annotation": "S"}, {"subclaim": " Bacterial ribosomes differ from human ribosomes", "similarity-score": 0.24710950243473054, "annotation": "S"}, {"subclaim": " Human cells do not have cell walls", "similarity-score": 0.2192968820631504, "annotation": "S"}]}, {"prompt": "how is enoxaparin dispensed", "original-output": "Enoxaparin is typically dispensed through a prefilled syringe for ease of administration and accuracy in dosing.
