        "Career. \"Hello, Dolly!\" was McAndrew's first credited film role. The role of Irene Molloy was given considerably more attention in the film than in earlier Broadway productions. \"Hello, Dolly!\" earned McAndrew two Golden Globe nominations in 1969; Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture and the since discontinued Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year \u2013 Actress, as well as generally good reviews. She landed a starring (second billed) role in her next film (\"The Seven Minutes\"). By 1971, she had made appearances in popular TV shows including \"Hawaii 5-0\", \"Mannix\", \"Cannon\" and \"Love, American Style\" One notable later film role was her co-starring role in \"The Bat People\", with her husband Stewart Moss. The film was widely panned, but is still somewhat known today as a \"bad film\". \"The Bat People\" was also her last film released in theaters; she has only worked in television since its release. Her only other later role of particular note is her role of Doris Williams in \"Growing Up Brady\", a TV film about the popular show. McAndrew, along with everything else related to the film \"Hello, Dolly!\" experienced something of a resurgence in popularity with the release of \"WALL-E\", which featured clips from the film, including a duet with McAndrew's character (but McAndrew did not do her own singing in the film, which some news outlets claimed in articles about \"WALL-E\").",

    "Chaim Malinowitz": [
        "Chaim Malinowitz Chaim Zev Malinowitz (1952 \u2013 November 21, 2019) was a Haredi community rabbi, dayan (rabbinical court judge), and Talmudic scholar. Fluent in all areas of the Talmud, halakha (Jewish law), and hashkafa (Orthodox Jewish worldview), he was the general editor of the 73-volume Schottenstein Edition of the Babylonian Talmud published by ArtScroll. After immigrating to Israel, he became the rabbi of Beis Tefillah Yonah Avraham, an English-speaking congregation for Anglophone Israeli immigrants in Ramat Beit Shemesh, which he led for 17 years.",
        "Early life and education. Chaim Zev Malinowitz was born in 1952 on the Lower East Side of New York City. His father, Rabbi Avrohom Aharon Malinowitz, had been a student of Aharon Kotler in Kletsk, Poland (historically Lithuania, now Belarus). Malinowitz was a gifted student at Rabbi Jacob Joseph School. After his bar mitzvah, he was accepted to the Talmudical Yeshiva of Philadelphia where, albeit younger than the other students, he skipped two grades and was accepted to the beth midrash (undergraduate-level) program under Rabbi Mendel Kaplan. His desire to have more time for study led him to begin awakening at 4 a.m. and praying \"vasikin\", the pre-dawn prayer, a practice he maintained for the rest of his life. He next studied at Yeshivas Iyun HaTalmud in Monsey, New York, under Rabbi Abba Berman, a main disciple of Rabbi Yerucham Levovitz. He remained at this yeshivah for six years, until his marriage in 1976, whereupon he entered the kollel. In 1980, he was appointed by Berman to take over as rosh kollel when Berman made aliyah to Israel. In the early 1970s, Malinowitz also studied the Tanya in a late-night \"shiur\" given by Chabad rabbi Yoel Kahn.",
        "Rabbinic career. After receiving rabbinic ordination from Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, Malinowitz served as a dayan (rabbinical court judge) for the rabbinical court of Kollel HaRabbanim in Monsey. In this role, he became known as a \"world authority on \"gittin\"\" (Jewish divorce) and also dealt with cases of \"agunos\". He staunchly opposed the 1992 New York Get Law proposed by Jewish activist groups, which would penalize husbands who refused to grant their wives a \"get\" by making it difficult for them to arrange a civil divorce. Malinowitz contended that the coercive element of the penalty could halakhically invalidate all divorces in New York. Ultimately, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach's decision on the matter, which agreed with Malinowitz's position, eroded support for the law. In 1992 Malinowitz was appointed, along with Rabbi Yisrael Simcha Schorr, as general editor of the Schottenstein Edition of the Babylonian Talmud published by ArtScroll. The English-language Schottenstein Talmud spanned 73 volumes and was completed over a period of 15 years. Malinowitz was responsible for approving \"every single line and every single footnote\" of the translation and commentary of the Talmud submitted by the editorial staff for both the English and Hebrew editions. According to a senior editor on the project, Rabbi Eliezer Herzka: \"His role was to learn through the \"sugya\" [topic] with the ArtScroll commentary to probe it to find its weak points\". Herzka explained that Malinowitz's knowledge of the Talmud was so broad that he would know when the present \"sugya\" inadequately covered important opinions by the classic Talmudic commentators that were cited in similar \"sugyas\" elsewhere in Talmud. Nothing was considered final until Malinowitz approved the finished draft. Malinowitz also worked on ArtScroll's elucidated Mishnah project. He continued his association with ArtScroll after making aliyah in 1997. Upon moving to Israel, Malinowitz began to teach at Yeshivat Aish HaTorah. In 2002, he was hired as Rav of Beis Tefillah Yonah Avraham in Ramat Beit Shemesh, an English-speaking congregation catering to Anglo \"olim\". As a community rav, Malinowitz introduced many \"shiurim\" to the synagogue schedule, including classes on different subjects and at different levels for men, women, and children. He also studied one-on-one with many congregants.",
        "Personal qualities. Malinowitz was fluent in all areas of the Talmud, halakha (Jewish law), and hashkafa (Orthodox Jewish worldview). He combined this knowledge with \"fearlessness\" to act on his convictions and a strong desire for truth. At the same time, he was regarded as a friendly, \"down to earth\" personality who cared for others.",
        "Personal life. Malinowitz married Simi Maza, daughter of Rabbi Dovber Maza, a Torah educator, in 1976. The couple had six sons and four daughters. After making aliyah, they resided in Jerusalem. Malinowitz died in Jerusalem on November 21, 2019 at the age of 67. He was buried in the Rechovot cemetery near his parents.",

    "Quintus Sosius Senecio": [
        "Quintus Sosius Senecio Quintus Sosius Senecio ( 1st century AD) was a Roman senator who was favored by the emperors Domitian and Trajan. As a result of this relationship, he was twice ordinary consul, an unusual and prestigious honor: first in 99, with Aulus Cornelius Palma Frontonianus as his colleague; and again in 107 as the colleague of Lucius Licinius Sura, who was himself consul for the third time.",
        "Career. Senecio's origins are unknown. He has been identified as the subject of an inscription where the name of the subject is lost, which provides us his \"cursus honorum\". The earliest office recorded on this inscription was \"quattuorviri viarum curandarum\", one of the four boards that comprised the \"vigintiviri\"; membership in one of these was a required first step toward a gaining entry into the Roman Senate. His next recorded office was as quaestor of the senatorial province of Achaea; upon completion of this traditional Republican magistracy he would be enrolled in the Senate. The inscription omits all mention of a term of service as military tribune; John D. Grainger speculates that Senecio may have served with Legio XXI Rapax, which was destroyed by the Iazyges in 92. He was the emperor's candidate for plebeian tribune and praetor, a clear honor; that the emperor's name is not provided suggests he was Domitian, who suffered \"damnatio memoriae\" after his death. After achieving the rank of praetor, Senecio was commissioned \"legatus legionis\" or commander of Legio I Minervia. He was then appointed \"legatus pro praetore\" or governor of Gallia Belgica for the term 96 to 98. It was while governor that Senecio provided early support to Trajan. Senecio became consul ordinarius in 99. During the Dacian Wars, he held the governorship of Moesia Inferior. Afterwards he earned a second consulate in 107 as well as a statue at state expense.",
        "Personal details. Senecio was a member of literary circles. Pliny the Younger addressed two letters to a \"Senecio\" who is commonly identified with him. The first, beginning with \"This year has produced a healthy crop of poets\", is on the health of contemporary Roman literature. The second is a request for a commission as military tribune on behalf of a relative of Pliny's friend Gaius Calvisius Rufus. Plutarch also dedicated several of his \"Parallel Lives\" (\"Theseus\" 1, \"Demosthenes\" 1, \"Brutus\" 1) as well some of the individual \"Moralia\" (\"Quaestiones conviviales\" and \"Quomodo quis suos in virtute sentiat profectus\") to Senecio. These include reminiscences about Plutarch's and Senecio's conversations at Athens, Patras and Rome, as well as at Plutarch's home in Boeotia, where Senecio attended the wedding of Plutarch's son. Senecio married the daughter of Sextus Julius Frontinus, a three-time consul (cos. 97, 98, 100). They had a daughter, Sosia Polla, who married Quintus Pompeius Falco.",

        "Career. King originally took up racewalking after being encouraged by his athletics club's coach. He competed in the 2002 Commonwealth Games at the age of 19, but was disqualified during the fifth lap after being in fourth place. At the 2006 Commonwealth Games, he finished in seventh place. King took a four-year break from international competition prior to competing at a 2012 World Cup event in Saransk, Russia, where he finished in 51st place with his second-fastest time ever. At the Dudinska 50\u00a0km in Dudince, Slovakia, he set a new personal best of four hours, six minutes 34 seconds, eight minutes faster than his previous best. This placed him within the Olympic \"B\" qualifying time for the 2012 Summer Olympics of 4 hours and 9 minutes. King suffered from a sleepless night after selectors did not let him know of his inclusion in the British team for the Games prior to the public announcement. The selectors had previously informed him that he would find out the day before the announcement. He was named as a member of the British squad, after being the only British athlete to achieve the qualifying time in the men's 50\u00a0km walk. King is the first competitor in the event for Great Britain since Chris Maddocks who competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Prior to the Olympics, he underwent altitude training with other members of the British squad in the Pyrenees. In the walk, he finished 51st, posting the time of 4:15.05. On the final lap, he gave hi-fives to members of the supportive home-crowd and games makers. His was the last ranked result of all participants of the walk. Just one month after the 2012 Olympic Games, Dominic won the National Long Distance Walking Championships, completing 100 miles in 18 hours, 13 minutes and 9 seconds, and becoming centurion number C1098.

She has warned that mental illness cases are on the rise, and with that in mind, about 30% of the population has yet to receive governmental aid. This is likely attributed to the fact that the Secretary of Health only channels 2.2% of their resources into the treatment of mental health. Medina-Mora Icaza also mentions how a good number of COVID-19 survivivors experience outcomes ranging from delusions, psychosis, and even serious neurological disorders. Other common lingering ailments due to COVID-19 include headaches, altered consciousness, convulsions, and the absence of taste and smell. She has found that the prevalence of anxiety disorders and antisocial behaviors is greatest among youth between 12 and 17 years of age, which also happens to be the same demographic that is second in the consumption of drugs. Furthermore, the prevalence of mental disorders has increased among those between 18 and 26 years of age. She warns that merely treating mental illness alone isn\u2019t enough, we must also strive to remedy the social determinants that cause mental illness.",

In 1990, with 19 years, he won the poetry prize Luis Rogelio Nogueras in Havana with his first book \"El llanto del escriba\", published two years afterwards. It was followed by \"Relicarios\" (1994) and \"Las palabras pedestres\" (1996). The latter won the David prize of poetry of the previous year. Fernandez Fe wrote his first novella, \"La Falacia\", in 1996. \u201cA work of deep anxiety and odd maturity\u2026 (\u2026)\", according to the Cuban writer and Leonardo Padura.\"It is an indisputable sign that a new narrator has born in Cuba (\u2026).\u201d. The novella received an honorable mention in the Contest Italo Calvino, of which Padura was one of the jurors. The book of essay \"Cuerpo a diario\" (2007) is a curious panorama on diaries written in extreme situations like war, illness or living in totalitarian states. In the 2011 he published \"El \u00faltimo d\u00eda del estornino\". For the critic Jeff Lawrence, this book marks \"the insertion of Fern\u00e1ndez Fe in an important current of contemporary Latin American writers like Ricardo Piglia, Roberto Bola\u00f1o, and Juan Villoro\". Rafael Rojas thinks that in this novel there is \"a multiple invention of writing, text, authorship and reader, trying to destabilize the poetic traditions of the Cuban literature of the last half century\" Fernandez Fe lives in the United States since 2013. Of his book \"Notas al total\", published in 2015, the Cuban critic Gilberto Padilla C\u00e1rdenas has said: \"\"Notas al total\" was probably the best book published by a Cuban writer in the year 2015. GFF Is in the Hall of the Fame of the Cuban essay (...) While the others age, GFF rejuvenates with a literature (...) that reads like a battle of other genres -journalism, history, testimony, etc.- against the nirvana of the traditional forms.\" In the prologue of \"Hotel Singapur\" (2021), Cuban novelist Abilio Est\u00e9vez says that the novel \"highlights what \"La Falacia\" and \"El \u00faltimo d\u00eda del estornino\" seemed to make quite clear: Gerardo Fern\u00e1ndez Fe is already one of the essential Cuban writers born after 1959\".

He was widely referred to simply as \"Triv\" by callers and the Cleveland media.",
        "Career. He was a frequent caller on the \"Sportsline\" radio show on WTAM AM 1100 (during this period the station was operating under the WWWE call letters). The show was hosted by the acerbic Pete Franklin and dealt with Cleveland sports. Franklin, who would typically cut off most callers, began giving \"Mike from Mayfield\" some latitude due to knowledgeable commentary, particularly regarding the Cleveland Browns. Franklin began mockingly referring to Trivisonno as \"Mr. Know It All,\" a moniker he would carry into his own radio career. Trivisonno eventually began his own broadcasting career in 1987, working for a time at WNCX, commenting on sports (particularly boxing) and becoming a full-time personality from 1989\u20131992. He began hosting \"Sportsline\" on WWWE in 1994. At first, the show aired from 6-11 p.m. The show did well in the ratings, even though it was usually up against Cleveland Indians games on WKNR. It did so well, the decision was made to put Trivisonno in afternoon drive-time (under the \"Sportsline\" banner until 1998; under his own name since) ultimately leaving \"Sportsline\" to other hosts. Throughout the program's history, \"The Mike Trivisonno Show\" was usually either first or second in ratings in its time slot in the market. His show had been originally dedicated mostly to sports, but over time became a forum for discussing sports, politics, local issues, current events, or whatever else was on Trivisonno's mind at the time. He discussed topics (and frequently argued) with listeners who called in to the show and/or with his various producers and sidekicks that worked alongside him. Trivisonno's popularity and high ratings led him to be ranked numerous times among \"Talkers Magazine's\" \"Heavy Hundred\", including most recently in 2015, when he came in at #72. He was also a nominee for the Large Market Personality of the Year Marconi Award in 2010.",
        "Personal life. Trivisonno was born in East Cleveland, Ohio, and attended Mayfield High School in Cleveland's eastern suburbs. He was married to his high school sweetheart Linda Conforto, who died of lung and brain cancer in 2009, at age 61. The couple have three children, two sons and a daughter, and two grandchildren. On April 1, 2011, Trivisonno married his girlfriend, Tami in Las Vegas. His brother, Gary, a golfer, was also a radio personality on WTAM, hosting a weekly golf show. His son, Michael Jr., owns an upscale restaurant called Trivs in suburban Strongsville, Ohio. He died unexpectedly on October 28, 2021, at the age of 74. The cause of death is unknown."

    "Prince Rivers": [
        "Prince Rivers Prince R. Rivers (1824\u20131887) was a former enslaved man from South Carolina who served as a soldier in the Union Army and as a state politician during the Reconstruction era. He escaped and joined Union lines, becoming a sergeant in the 1st South Carolina Volunteers, a Union regiment in the American Civil War. He had gained literacy as an enslaved man and after the war joined the Republican Party. He served as a delegate to the 1868 South Carolina Constitutional Convention, becoming known as an orator. He was one of three African-American founders of Aiken County in 1871, helped pick the site for the courthouse, and served as the state legislator from the county through 1874. He also served as a trial judge.",
        "Early life and education. Born into slavery in Beaufort, South Carolina, Prince R. Rivers worked on the Henry Middleton Stuart, Sr. (1803\u20131872) or H.M. Stuart plantation known as Oak Point or Pages Point. He served with the household staff and as carriage driver, among the elite of the estate's slaves, and learned to read and write. He escaped from slavery in 1862 after his master moved with his slaves to Edgefield County. Rivers stole one of Stuart's horses and rode through the Confederate lines to Beaufort, which was occupied by Union troops. He volunteered to enlist in the Union Army. By the summer of 1862, more than 10,000 slaves had fled from Lowcountry and Midlands plantations to join Union lines along the coast.",
        "Serving the Union Army. Rivers was among the slaves (and their families) declared free in 1862 by Union General David Hunter under Congress' Confiscation Act of 1861. Hunter's decision was considered controversial, and the general was prohibited from enlisting former slaves. But they served in \"Hunter's Regiment\" with unpaid status for a time, and Rivers said he never regretted it. In 1863, Rivers became a non-commissioned officer in the newly formed 1st South Carolina Volunteers of the United States Colored Troops. His commanding officer, Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson, wanted to promote him to a commissioned rank but was prevented by his superiors because of Rivers' race. Higginson said of Rivers in an 1865 article in \"The Liberator,\" \"No anti-slavery novel has described a man of such marked ability. He makes Toussaint perfectly intelligible; and if there should ever be a black monarchy in South Carolina, he will be its king.\" The 1st South Carolina Volunteers and other African-American soldiers were promised at enlistment in writing to be paid the same as other soldiers. However, under the Militia Act of 1862, were paid less than half that. They and their supporters lobbied the government but did not gain full pay until June 1864, when an Act of Congress granted them equal pay, including what they were due retroactively. Nearly 180,000 African Americans served in the war and were critical to Union victory.",
        "Reconstruction era. After the war, Rivers returned to the Edgefield District, eventually settling on a farm outside Hamburg, which became a black-majority town in this period, with a thriving community. He entered the Republican Party and became active in state politics. He had reportedly learned to read and write while a slave, and proved to be a skilled orator and essayist. He served as registrar for Edgefield County in 1867. In the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1868, he was the delegate from Edgefield. He was elected as a state legislator and later as a trial judge, and was deeply involved with Reconstruction politics. Rivers was one of three African-American founders of Aiken County, established by the state legislature in 1871 during Reconstruction, and he helped pick the site for the county courthouse. After a redistricting in 1872, Rivers was the state representative from the newly organized Aiken County. He later served as mayor, county coroner and justice of the peace, all local offices newly available to black candidates. In 1876, Prince Rivers was the judge in a hearing in Hamburg related to events on July 4, when white farmers claimed that an all-black unit of the National Guard blocked the street by their parade on Independence Day. The hearing was attended by more than 100 armed members from nearby Red Shirts chapters, among the thousands of armed white men in rifle clubs; the farmers' lawyer demanded that the black militia be disarmed. Though Rivers tried in a separate meeting to persuade the local Guard militia to give up their weapons, and the white paramilitary to back down, his efforts failed. The freedmen retreated to the armory and held off an attack by the white militia, in which one white man died. They tried to escape after seeing the white militia bring up a cannon. Two blacks were killed on the street, and the white militia captured about 25 freedmen who had left the armory. They murdered four outright later that night while holding them as prisoners at what was called the Dead Ring, and wounded seven other black men. After the trial, Rivers' home was burned and property stolen or destroyed by Red Shirts. Violence continued in the following weeks as the white militia worked to suppress black voting in the Upland counties, with a massacre of an estimated 30-100 blacks over several days in September in Ellenton. The Democrats regained control of the state legislature and governor's office in 1876, in an election marked by fraud. It was settled in a national compromise by which the Republican administration agreed to withdraw federal troops from the South, officially ending Reconstruction. In South Carolina, white Democrats passed laws to impose segregation and \"Jim Crow\", and continued violence at elections, but African-American George Henry White was elected to US Congress in the 1890s. In 1895 the Democrats passed a new constitution that included requirements that effectively disfranchised blacks in the state. After the rise of whites and imposition of white supremacy, Rivers worked as a house painter and coachman until his death at age 65."

    "Zamfir Arbore": [
        "Zamfir Arbore Zamfir Constantin Arbore (; born Zamfir Ralli,, \"Zemfiriyi Konstantinovich Arborye-Ralli\"; also known as Zamfir Arbure, Zamfir Rally, Zemphiri Ralli and Aivaza; November 14, 1848 \u2013 April 2 or April 3, 1933) was a Bukovinian-born Romanian political activist originally active in the Russian Empire, also known for his work as an amateur historian, geographer and ethnographer. Arbore debuted in left-wing politics from early in life, gained an intimate knowledge of the Russian revolutionary milieu, and participated in both nihilist and Narodnik conspiracies. Self-exiled to Switzerland, he became a member of the International Workingmen's Association. Arbore was mostly active as an international anarchist and a disciple of Mikhail Bakunin, but eventually parted with the latter to create his independent group, the Revolutionary Community. He was subsequently close to the anarchist geographer \u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus, who became his new mentor. Arbore settled in Romania after 1877, and, abandoning anarchism altogether, committed himself to the more moderate cause of socialism. His campaign against Russian despotism also led him to champion the cause of freedom for Bessarabia region, to which he was personally tied by his family history. These commitments resulted in Arbore's outside support for the Russian Revolution of 1905, when he and Petru Cazacu founded the Swiss-based \"Basarabia\" newspaper. Arbore had by then earned academic credentials with his detailed works on Bessarabian geography, and, as a cultural journalist, cultivated relationships with socialist and National Liberal activists. He was also notoriously the friend of poet Mihai Eminescu in the 1880s, and worked closely with writer Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu during the 1890s. During World War I, Zamfir Arbore provoked controversy when he supported a Romanian alliance with the Central Powers, justified in his opinion by a need to liberate Bessarabia. Despite this, and although he publicly welcomed the October Revolution, Arbore was reintegrated into the political scene of Greater Romania, serving two terms in Senate. Before his death in 1933, he was drawn into agrarian and cooperativist politics, and was successively a member of the Peasants' Party and the People's Party. Arbore was survived by his two daughters, both of them famous in their own right: Ecaterina was a communist politician and physician; Nina a modern artist.",
        "Biography.",
        "Biography.:Origins and early life. Zamfir Ralli was the scion of boyar aristocracy from the principality of Moldavia: his paternal grandfather Zamfirache Ralli was an ennobled Greek merchant, married into the local Romanian elite; Zamfir's mother was an ethnic Ukrainian. Although cosmopolitan, the future activist always prioritized his Romanian roots, changing his birth name to \"Arbore\" (var. \"Arbure\") in the belief that his Romanian ancestors had inherited the name and boyar status from the ancient Arbore family. Zamfirache's son Constantin, the friend of poet Alexander Pushkin, was reputedly adopted by Dimitrie Arbore. He also inherited a Bessarabian manorial estate in Dolna, which in the 1820s had served as the Pushkin's vacation house. The subsequent genealogical claim traced the family history back to the late 15th century, with \"Hetman\" Luca Arbore. It also made Zamfir a distant relative of various members of Romanian socialist environment, including Vasile Mor\u021bun and Izabela Sadoveanu. The claim's reliability divides modern researchers. While historian of journalism Victor Frunz\u0103 sees Arbore as descending \"from an ancient family of local boyars\", academic Lucian Boia describes Zamfir Arbore as being tied to the historical Arbores by \"a rather thin line\". Boia also notes that Arbore's \"revised past\" and arbitrary interpretation of his own background may have been opportunistic, leaving Arbore free to gravitate between conflicting national identities and rendering his radical discourse more palatable for all cultural contexts. According to political scientist Armand Go\u0219u, Arbore had effectively \"stolen\" his grandmother's maiden name, reviving an otherwise extinct boyar line. Although mostly active in Bessarabia, Arbore was actually a native of Chernowitz (), the administrative center of Bukovina within the Austrian Empire (now Chernivtsi, Ukraine). He later moved into Bessarabia (the Russian-ruled Bessarabian Governorate), attending school in Kishinev (Chi\u0219in\u0103u), before moving to another school in Nikolayev. During his troubled youth, Arbore-Ralli underwent medical training in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, but was more involved within the revolutionary, nihilist and pan-Russian anarchist underground, with the goal of subverting Tsarist autocracy. His political sympathies also connected him with the Narodnik movement, which he joined at the same time as other young Bessarabian intellectuals (Victor Cr\u0103sescu, Axinte Frunz\u0103, Constantin Stere, Nicolae Zubcu-Codreanu) who saw a link between their nationalist struggle and the agrarian cause of Russian Narodniks (he is believed to have been personally acquainted with the agrarian theorist and Narodnik father figure Alexander Herzen).",
        "Biography.:In Switzerland. The subversive activities brought Zamfir to the attention of Tsarist authorities, particularly after his involvement in Sergey Nechayev's nihilist conspiracy of 1869. Unable to finish his studies, Arbore was singled out for arrest, and according to his own account, since placed under doubt, even served time as a political prisoner in the Peter and Paul Fortress and in Siberia. Eventually, he made his way to Switzerland, where he contacted international anarchist figures such as Mikhail Bakunin and \u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus. Arbore corresponded with the latter for a significant period, sharing his interest in social geography. His complex relationship with radical exiles also resulted in contacts with anarcho-communist theorist Peter Kropotkin and the Bulgarian anarchist sympathizer Hristo Botev. He was also, with philosopher Vasile Conta, one of the few intellectuals with a Romanian background to affiliate directly with the International Workingmen's Association (First International), which regrouped the various Marxist and anarchist communities of Europe. In tandem, Arbore was active within Bakunin's Revolutionary Brotherhood, and, according to anarchist historian George Woodcock, one of the \"most influential\" among the Russian propagators of Bakuninism; political historian James H. Billington also refers to \"Zemfiry Ralli\" as \"Bakunin's principal editor\". Arbore's beliefs led him to join the Jura federation, an anarchist cell within the First International, and to become initiated into Freemasonry (1872). He became strongly opposed to Bakunin's marginalization during the First International's Hague Congress, and signed his name (\"Z. Ralli\") to a letter of protest, alongside Nikolay Ogarev. Also in 1872, Arbore also helped draft the German-language pamphlet which documented Bakunin's condemnation of Nechayev: \"Ist Netshaejeff ein politischer Verbrecher oder nicht?\" (\"Is Nechayev a Political Felon, or Is He Not?\"). With Bakunin and Errico Malatesta, he was personally involved in the anarchist agitation sweeping Restoration Spain during the 1870s: he personally helped translate Bakunin's letter to the Iberian anarchists, but their hopes of inciting a new revolution were unsuccessful; progressively after that moment, Arbore and Bakunin grew estranged from one another. According to Woodcock, the reason behind this \"personal\" rather than ideological conflict was Bakunin's \"tactless\" support for Arbore's adversary Mikhail Sanzhin, leading Arbore and his partners, the \"young Bakuninists\", to establish the Revolutionary Community organization. The reasons and objectives of this group, whose other members were Vladimir Holstein, Alexander Oelsnitz and Nikolai Ivanovich Zhukovsky, were outlined in a letter to Jura anarchist James Guillaume. Moving from Zurich to Geneva, and known primarily as \"Ralli\", Arbore ran a socialist publishing house, through which he helped popularize the political manifestos of anarchism, as well as his own history of the Paris Commune. He was among those who established, in 1875, the Genevan Russian-language newspaper \"Rabotnik\" (\"The Worker\"), which bridged the \"young Bakuninist\" faction with the Eser Party of Vera Figner and Reclus' St. Imier International. One of his colleagues there, future astronomer Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov, recalled that Arbore was actively involved in redacting news arriving from Russia, manipulating them for dramatic effect and political conformity. In 1875, he also wrote and published the anarchist tract \"Sytye i golodnye\" (\"The Sated and the Hungry\"), as well as an appeal to Ukrainian peasants in the Russian Empire. The Swiss period was the start of his new family life. Arbore was by then married, to the Russian Ecaterina Hardina. The dowry she brought helped maintain his new publishing venture. His eldest child was daughter Ecaterina Arbore-Ralli, the future communist, feminist and militant physician, born on November 11, 1873, at Bex. His son Dumitru (Mitic\u0103) was born on January 11, 1877, in Geneva.",
        "Biography.:Relocation to Romania. Zamfir Arbore first set foot in Romania during 1873, when he traveled from Geneva to Ia\u0219i, meeting with the young socialist sympathizer Eugen Lupu. He was later in contact with the Ia\u0219i Marxist circle of Ioan, Iosif and Sofia N\u0103dejde, sending them books by Karl Marx and his anarchist commentators (Johann Most, Carlo Cafiero). Arbore also established contacts with the socialist cell of Bucharest. He corresponded with some of the Russian socialists who had set up camp there, primarily so with Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea and Nicolae Zubcu-Codreanu. Together, they set up the Society for Student Culture and Solidarity, a semi-clandestine club located at the Concordia Hotel. Again in Switzerland, he took part in the violent Red Flag Riot of Berne, organized in 1877 by the anarchist dissidence of the International\u2014allegedly, his life was saved by fellow anarchist Jacques Gross. In 1878, Arbore was also the editor of the international tribune of the Revolutionary Community, \"Obshchina\" (\"Community\"), which was published as a successor of \"Rabotnik\". Reputedly threatened with an extradition back into the Russian Empire, Zamfir Arbore moved to Romania after the beginning of a Russo-Turkish War, during which the country, a Russian ally, obtained her independence from the Ottoman Empire. He later recalled that the inspiration for this move was young Romanian leftist Mircea Rosetti, whom he had first met during Reclus' visit to Vevey. Arbore's original goal was the spread of revolutionary propaganda among soldiers in the Imperial Russian Army, but, in short time, he settled down in Bucharest. It was there that Arbore fathered a second daughter, Lolica, who died without reaching maturity. Arbore later set up, with fellow exiles Dobrogeanu-Gherea, Zubcu-Codreanu, Pavel Axelrod and Nikolai Sudzilovsky (Russel), an underground political movement agitating for the cause of Bessarabian Romanians; by means of this group, he is said to have gained access within the governing National Liberal Party, even earning discreet support from two of its leading figures, Ion Br\u0103tianu and C. A. Rosetti (father of Mircea Rosetti). Arbore would later speak of Br\u0103tianu as a discreet supporter of his projects to undermine Russian governments. Additionally, C. A. Rosetti is alleged to have personally assisted Arbore and Zubcu-Codreanu, who shared a Bucharest apartment, from evading both the persistent scrutiny of Romanian Police forces and the threat of extradition. In May 1877, Police forces quashed the Concordia hotel club, arresting various of its members. Arbore's connections were unsuccessful when it came to rescuing Dobrogeanu-Gherea, kidnapped and deported by the Russian Army in autumn 1877, although he eventually helped track down Gherea in Russia. Three years later, when Dobrogeanu-Gherea escaped back to Romania, Arbore helped him set up a restaurant in Ploie\u0219ti station, from which Gherea supported his family. Another National Liberal figure, the Bessarabian historian Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, also cultivated a friendship with Arbore. According to Arbore's own recollections, although he and Hasdeu had been separated by \"political-social views\", they had been brought together by the recent deaths of Iulia Hasdeu and Lolica Arbore. Their shared loss, Arbore recalled, was leading them both to seek intellectual comfort in spiritualism or spiritism: Arbore, who was in correspondence with spiritists Camille Flammarion and William Crookes, recalled having joined a secretive spiritualist circle formed in Hasdeu's home, and being ridiculed in the Romanian press over this issue. Hasdeu was one of the noted guests in Arbore's own house.",
        "Biography.:1880s politics. After the Trial of the Fourteen, the Revolutionary Community and all other Bakuninist groups were losing the battle in front of renewed Tsarist repression. Arbore, who now criticized Bakunian anarchism, quickly came to the conclusion that a socialist party was needed as a more radical alternative to the Romanian two-party system: in 1879, he helped organize the first-ever conference of Romanian socialist clubs, and, over the following months, was member of the editorial staff at \"Rom\u00e2nia Viitoare\", the socialist review (as a result of his participation, the magazine also enlisted contributions from Reclus and his brother \u00c9lie, as well as from poet Louis-Xavier de Ricard). The next year, he and the N\u0103dejdes were briefly in contact with the senior political radical Titus Dunka, distributing for a while Dunka's gazette \"\u00cenainte!\" (\"Forward!\"). In 1880, after a failed attempt on Ion Br\u0103tianu's life, the socialist circles faced government suspicion and became less organized, a situation which lasted until the election of 1888. At the time, Arbore was editor of Rosetti's democratic gazette \"Rom\u00e2nul\", and later moved to a similar position with the left-leaning newspaper \"Telegraful Rom\u00e2n\". Also at that stage, he befriended the Bukovinian Mihai Eminescu, later recognized as Romania's national poet, but at the time a secondary figure in the Bucharest press. Eminescu, who worked for the Conservative Party tribune \"Timpul\", confided in Arbore about his pessimistic vision of Romanian society. At this stage, Arbore is believed to have helped other foreign-born socialists to find refuge in Romania: in particular to have assisted Peter (Petru) Alexandrov, the brother-in-law of writer Vladimir Korolenko, in obtaining a license to practice medicine in Tulcea and in defending himself during subsequent police inquiries. In 1881, he was himself naturalized a citizen of the newly proclaimed Kingdom of Romania. By summer 1883, when Arbore too lost National Liberal support and was briefly expelled from Romania, Eminescu had become afflicted with mental illness (he eventually died in relative isolation, in 1889). Arbore was, around 1890, a correspondent for Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dam\u00e9's Bucharest newspaper \"La Libert\u00e9 Roumaine\", with expos\u00e9 pieces on the kidnapping of junior Bulgarian Navy officer Vladimir Kisimov by Russian spies. His third daughter Nina, later known as a visual artist, was born in January 1888. The elder, Ecaterina, was already taking her first steps in socialist politics, as a delegate to the International Congress of Students, held in Giurgiu. Meanwhile, Zamfir Arbore was progressively integrated into the Romanian civil service: a clerk at the State Archives, he became a statistician in service to the Bucharest City Hall (from 1896 to 1920). As a socialist activist, he was coming to support the faction of Dobrogeanu-Gherea and Constantin Mille, who published \"Lumea Nou\u0103\" review and ultimately set up the short-lived Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party (PSDMR).",
        "Biography.:\"Amicul Copiilor\" and scientific work. From 1891 to 1898, he and Victor Cr\u0103sescu (who signed with the pen name \"\u0218tefan Basarabescu\") were founders and managers of \"Amicul Copiilor\" (\"The Children's Friend\") magazine, which circulated classic works of children's literature and is sometimes rated as the first comic book magazine in Romanian history. Hasdeu, one of its main writers, is occasionally given credit as the person behind \"Amicul Copiilor\". Arbore himself experimented with the genre, publishing children's versions of \"Don Quixote\", \"Tartarin of Tarascon\" and \"Robinson Crusoe\", as well as popular histories\u2014one about Ancient Egypt, the other about 1821 rebel Tudor Vladimirescu. Hasdeu co-opted Arbore for the early 1899 project to create a professional association of writers as part of his Press Society (an actual Romanian Writers' Society was only created some 10 years later, after Hasdeu's death). As statistician, Arbore was in charge of Bucharest's \"Buletinul Statistic\" (\"Statistical Bulletin\") and of the City Hall Library, which under his direction acquired several thousands of new books. With Ioan N\u0103dejde, Arbore translated into Romanian the Russian Commercial Code. In parallel, he completed his main and lengthiest study in ethnography, \"Basarabia \u00een secolul XIX\" (\"Bessarabia in the 19th Century\"), first published in 1898. It earned its author the annual Ion Heliade R\u0103dulescu Prize of the Romanian Academy. Beginning 1903, he also taught Russian at the Bucharest War School. Arbore followed up on his scholarly work with the 1904 \"Dic\u021bionar geografic al Basarabiei\" (\"A Geographical Dictionary of Bessarabia\"). The same year, he was a voluntary contributor, with Bessarabian-themed entries, to the first-ever Romanian encyclopedic dictionary: \"Enciclopedia rom\u00e2n\u0103\", published in Austria-Hungary by Cornelius Diaconovich and ASTRA cultural society. In 1906, during the National Exhibit held in celebration of the Romanian Kingdom (and one year before the large-scale peasants' revolt), Arbore joined a scientific committee which supervised an academic inquiry into the state of Romanian peasants, whose main author was militant sociologist G. D. Scraba.",
        "Biography.:1905 Revolution. Before and during the Russian Revolution of 1905, Arbore was also involved in trafficking subversive works of literature over the Romanian\u2013Russian border, hoping to encourage a rebellion among Bessarabian Romanian peasants and intellectuals. Theodor Incule\u021b, a theologian and political agitator, was one of his connections there. As Incule\u021b later wrote, the books \"sent over by Arbure\" were unequivocally \"anti-Russian\". In 1904, Mikhail Nikolayevich von Giers, the Russian Ambassador to Romania, warned National Liberal Premier Dimitrie Sturdza that \"Mr. Ralli-Arbore\" intended to send into Russia many small packages of brochures, to be delivered by a special network of socialist agents. This exchange of notes degenerated into a major diplomatic incident when some of the contraband books were confiscated by Russian officials, and discovered to contain firearms. Arbore was singled out for extradition, but saved through the intercession of Take Ionescu, the Interior Minister, who even managed to have the weapons dispatched back to Romania. This was the beginning of an unusually close relationship with Romania's conservative environment and King Carol I (to whom he dedicated a volume of his memoirs). Reportedly as a favor to the Bessarabian activist, Carol was to allow safe passage into Romania to the wanted Russian Eser assassin Boris Savinkov. According to Arbore's own account, Carol, \"the founder of modern Romania\", privately resented Russia's national policy on Bessarabia. Zamfir Arbore also welcomed into his house the \"Potemkin\" mutiny refugees\u2014including socialist sailor Afanasi Matushenko, who became his close friend. He registered another personal triumph in 1905, when his aging friend Reclus also traveled to Romania. However, his main interest was by then outside the realm of socialist or anarchist politics. Together with Petru Cazacu, Arbore founded and edited a newspaper named \"Basarabia\", printed in Switzerland but clandestinely circulated the Russian Empire during the Revolution. \"Basarabia\" went out of print after six consecutive issues, and, throughout its existence advertised itself as a Chi\u0219in\u0103u-based paper (although its editorial office was located in Geneva). An immediate predecessor for the legal \"Basarabia\" of 1906, it was noted for its radical support of Bessarabian autonomy, demands for universal suffrage, and adoption of a modern Romanian alphabet instead of traditional Moldavian Cyrillic letters. In its final issue, Arbore and Cazan's gazette published the program of an incipient National Moldavian Party. After the Revolution toned down repression, Arbore could also collaborate with the Saint Petersburg-based socialist magazine \"Byloye\", which published his biographical sketch of Sergey Nechayev. The text, signed \"Zemfir Ralli Arbore\", notably includes detail on Nechayev's isolated political outlook, which, Arbore argued, was linked directly to 18th century Jacobin theorists and agitators (Maximilien de Robespierre, Philippe Buonarroti) rather than to later socialist schools.",
        "Biography.:\"Milcovul\" Society and PSDR connections. By 1908, Arbore had founded another venue for pro-Bessarabian political activism, the \"Milcovul\" Society (named after the Milcov River, a symbol of Romanian unity). The association was soon after infiltrated by the Russian spy Gheorghe V. Madan: exposed through a public scandal, Madan was expelled from \"Milcovul\" by Arbore's own vote. The controversy drew attention from Romania's secret service, \"Siguran\u021ba Statului\", whose agents suspected, probably without just cause, that Arbore maintained contacts with Madan over the following period. In June 1909, Constantin Mille's daily, \"Adev\u0103rul\", printed a draft of Arbore's memoirs, dealing with Eminescu's political views. During the same years, Arbore played host to a new generation of Romanian socialist leaders and leaders of the local labor movement, who attempted to recreate a socialist party from the defunct PSDMR: Christian Rakovsky, Gheorghe Cristescu, I. C. Frimu and N. D. Cocea. Arbore did not join the Romanian Social Democratic Party (PSDR), created by Rakovsky in 1910, but was a special guest at its reunions. He was thus present at the PSDR's 1912 rally at \"Sala Dacia\", where, in agreement with Rakovsky's political tenets, he spoke about the need to contain Russian imperialism; on the centenary of Bessarabia's occupation, he also addressed Romanian student organizations, informing them about the state of affairs in Russian dominions. Arbore was also claiming that some violent anarchists were in fact Russian agents: according to him, the suspected terrorist Ilie C\u0103t\u0103r\u0103u was a secret affiliate of the loyalist Black Hundreds. In September 1914, Arbore was honored by the PSDR's festive assembly honoring the 50th anniversary of the First International. In parallel, he gave external support to unionizing efforts, being notably an honored guest at the Romanian Journalists' Union festivities of May 1912, where he mainly spoke about Bessarabia. His first-born daughter, who had by then made her first contributions to social medicine, became directly involved with the PSDR and the \"Rom\u00e2nia Muncitoare\" club, and, also in 1912, was elected to the PSDR Executive Committee. Dumitru, who was a chemical engineer in the thriving oil industry, and Nina, a debuting painter, were also both affiliated with PSDR at a grassroots level. During that interval, the Bessarabian scholar was also becoming interested in cultivating a rapprochement between Romania and the Kingdom of Bulgaria, Romania's new neighbor to the south. This was reflected in his set of contributions to Slavistics and philology. His Romanian-Bulgarian dictionary, \"\u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u043e-\u0440\u0443\u043c\u044a\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\", saw print in 1909. In 1912, Arbore translated and published for \"Minerva\" newspaper the 1886 manifesto \"To the Romanian People\", signed by Bulgarian revolutionary Zahari Stoyanov, in which Stoyanov spoke about his country's \"moral duty\" toward Romania and deplored the slow descent into ethnic rivalry.",
        "Biography.:World War I controversies. Arbore's activity as a publicist, activist and newspaperman flared up during the early stages of World War I, as Romania hesitated between joining the Entente Powers or honoring its loose commitment to the Central Powers, and in particular the German Empire. Like other Bessarabian exiles, Arbore objected to the first option, since it threw Romania into the same camp as the Russian Empire, opening the way for Russian domination in Romania, while leaving Bessarabia oppressed and Russified; he also identified the Ententist preoccupation with the Romanians of Transylvania and Bukovina as excessive, claiming that Austria-Hungary would inevitably transform itself into a democratic federation upon the end of war. These ideas made their way into his wartime articles for \"Seara\" newspaper and his standalone political essays: the 1914 \"Autonomia sau anexarea. Transilvania \u0219i Bucovina\" (\"Autonomy or Annexation. Transylvania and Bukovina\"), the 1915 \"Liberarea Basarabiei\" (\"The Liberation of Bessarabia\") and the 1916 \"Ukraina \u0219i Rom\u00e2nia\" (\"Ukraine and Romania\"). Of these, \"Liberarea Basarabiei\" was printed with support from an eponymous political society, the League for the Liberation of Bessarabia. Arbore's stance was compatible with the PSDR's Zimmerwald neutralism: by 1915, Ecaterina Arbore was also noted for her political statements against a Russian alliance. Internationally, her father collaborated with \"Annales des Nationalit\u00e9s\", the anti-imperialist periodical put out by Jean P\u00e9lissier and Juozas Gabrys. Suspicion arose that Arbore was also in the pay of German intelligence, receiving at least 28,000 lei through such channels. In summer 1916, Romania disappointed Arbore by rallying with the Entente. After a short-lived offensive into Transylvania, the Romanian Land Forces were defeated, and the Central Powers invaded southern Romania. Arbore stayed behind in German-occupied Bucharest while the legitimate government withdrew to Ia\u0219i, and maintained a generally friendly but discreet attitude toward the occupiers. He was less active as a journalist and militant, but contributed to the Germanophile daily \"Lumina\", put out by the Bessarabian activist Constantin Stere, and once lectured on the Bessarabian question during April 1918. Arbore also kept a low profile during the 1918 truce, when, with German acquiescence, Romania united with Bessarabia. Reputedly, Stere, who negotiated the union with the Bessarabian Assembly, mistrusted and sidelined Arbore during the events. In his own account of the wartime years, Arbore claimed to have been arrested on several occasions by the occupation authorities, but this claim, Boia notes, remains unverified and doubtful. Arbore was returning to a socialist discourse, probably rekindled and reshaped by news of the October Revolution in Russia. During the period, he took a personal interest in the fate of Russian prisoners held on occupied territory, and, in a letter to the Germanophile academic Ioan Bianu, spoke about the need to popularize revolutionary ideas among this particular group.",
        "Biography.:Senator and political suspect. After the unexpected German defeat of November 1918 brought a moral victory for Romanian Ententists and the return of Ententist forces in government, Arbore withstood scrutiny as an alleged collaborator with the enemy. In this context, he rallied with a new radical force, the Peasants' Party, and ran for political office in what was by then Greater Romania. During the November 1919 election, he presented himself as a Senate candidate for Chi\u0219in\u0103u, Bessarabia, and was elected. His new political credo was outlined in his Senate speech of December 27, 1918, which focused on proposals to change the 1866 constitutional regime and amend the prewar tradition of centralized government, while also outlining his main defense against suspicions of collaborationism. His daughter Ecaterina was rendered a suspect by her Socialist Party of Romania militancy. She further antagonized the public when, as a Communist Party of Romania founder, she supported the self-determination of Bessarabia and its separation from Romania, in line with Comintern policies. After being arrested several times, she made her may into the Soviet state. Dumitru Arbore also joined the Communist Party, was kept under surveillance by the authorities for hosting conspirative sessions at his home in Prahova County, but remained in Romania, where he died in an October 1921 accident. Arbore lost his Senate seat when Parliament was dissolved by King Ferdinand I; he soon after left the Peasants' Party, pushed into opposition, and was reelected to the Senate as a People's Party candidate in the summer 1920 election. Late in 1920, he was co-founder and secretary of the Socialist Peasants' Party, together with playwright Ion Peretz, publicist Ioan Pangal, abbot Iuliu Scriban etc. Withdrawn from national politics, Arbore again focused on his journalist's activity and was at the forefront of Romanian Freemasonry. His membership in the local subsidiary of the \"Grand Orient de France\" was confirmed in December 1922 by Mihail Noradunghian, and he was recognized as a Rank 33 Mason, Worshipful Master of Human Rights Lodge (located in Bucharest). On April 23, 1923, Arbore was elected Grand Master of a major Romanian Scottish Rite branch, the Grand Lodge (Grand Master for life after 1930), and was the Grand Orator for Romania within the Supreme Scottish Rite Council from 1929. These promotions were scrutinized by the anti-Masonic far right: in a public conference, Nicolae Paulescu of the National-Christian Defense League called Arbore the Grand Master of a \"Kike-Romanian Masonic group\". His own far left inclinations were by then contrasting with his civil service positions, which he maintained even as his daughter Ecaterina was becoming a \"persona non grata\". In 1923, Arbore published a new installment of his memoirs, as \"\u00cen temni\u021bele ruse\u0219ti\" (\"In the Russian Dungeons\"). In March 1924, he replaced Vasile Ghenzul as editorial director of \"Furnica\" (\"The Ant\"). The cooperativist and agrarian bimonthly was published in Bessarabia, and printed a Russian-language supplement. He was still a contributor to the central leftist press: in December 1926, \"Adev\u0103rul\" published his piece about the Serbian politician Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107, defunct leader of the People's Radical Party. During this interval, Ecaterina tried to return to Romania. According to the opinion of journalist Victor Frunz\u0103, she was trying to hide her growing disillusionment with communism under the pretext that she needed to take care of her ailing father. The Romanian authorities did not allow her entry into the country, and she was forced back. Zamfir and his wife had earlier adopted Dumitru's young child, Zamfir Dumitru Arbore.",
        "Biography.:Final years. In 1930, the recently widowed Zamfir Arbore was pensioned from his teaching position at the Bucharest War School, where he had also been lecturing in Geography and Topography. During the final years of his life, Arbore was a sporadic contributor to Pan Halippa's review \"Via\u021ba Basarabiei\". In tandem, his revolutionary past, in particular his early dealings with Hristo Botev, were also the subject of interviews with journalist Vasile Christu. His own output as a researcher included an undated monograph on his friend and ally Zubcu-Codreanu, who had died in 1878 (\"O pagin\u0103 din istoria socialismului rom\u00e2n\", \"A Page in the History of Romanian Socialism\"), as well as the collected memoirs: \"Temni\u021b\u0103 \u0219i exil\" (\"Prison and Exile\") and \"\u00cen exil. Amintirile mele\" (\"In Exile. My Memories\"). Zamfir Arbore died in Bucharest, on April 2 or April 3, 1933. He was buried at Sf\u00e2nta Vineri Cemetery, alongside Ecaterina, Dumitru, and Lolica Arbore. Paradoxically, his funeral ceremony comprised both the military honors owed to his position in the War School and revolutionary orations given in tribute by his socialist comrades. The socialist tribune \"Societatea de M\u00e2ine\" published an obituary, which referred to Arbore as \"one of the highest profile representative figures [in socialism], and one of the most worthy examples for all people-loving generations to follow.\"",
        "Political and scientific theories.",
        "Political and scientific theories.:Arbore's political program. Despite official promotion, Zamfir Arbore had serious trouble integrating his views within the political landscape of 20th century Romania. Critic and political historian Ioan Stanomir writes that Arbore, \"the agent who precipitates revolution\", was \"an aristocrat animated by dramatic self-loathing\". His Narodnik ideals subsided with time: according to literary historian Leonid Cemortan, Arbore was \"totally defeated\" in his Narodnik activity, realized that it was an \"unattainable dream\", but was nonetheless unable to \"verify and correct\" his vision. Arbore, who never registered his membership with any Romanian socialist party or faction, was reportedly perplexed by the antisemitism prevalent in his adoptive country, including among the Romanian socialists and trade unionists. His transition from anarchism to a more moderate platform was also shown by his treatment of the Bessarabian issue. In 1905, his \"Basarabia\" newspaper tied together demands of social reform with political and cultural goals, endorsing the planned land reform and demanding the official use of Romanian (\"Moldavian\") in the administrative apparatus and the Bessarabian Orthodox Church. Its demand for self-governance around an enlarged \"Sfat\" (\"Assembly\") referred back to promises made upon the creation of a Bessarabian Governorate. The entire program, scholar Marcel Mitra\u0219c\u0103 notes, was one of the first manifestations of \"Bessarabian [Romanian] nationalism\", the prototype for an agenda later espoused by the National Moldavian Party. Political analysts Mihai Cernencu and Igor Bo\u021ban suggest that the political doctrine supported by \"Basarabia\" was at once an early instance of Bessarabian liberalism and a regional affiliation to the Constitutional Democratic Party, somewhat permeated by the doctrines of social democracy. More intimately, Arbore was contemplating the possibility of an independent Bessarabia, free from what he considered to be the excesses of Romanian nationalism. By the end of his life, he was publicizing his disappointment with the political environment of Greater Romania and explaining his return to socialism. In a \"Via\u021ba Basarabiei\" article, he claimed: \"Wherever I look around me I see only decay. The old and the young, the cultivated and the illiterate, all behave equally, not even asking themselves what the meaning of their life is in the general progress of humanity. Living inside Romanian society I for one was not able to merge into it. [...] I haven't had and I still don't have friends in Romania.\" His attitude, including claims that Bessarabia was being colonized by rapacious Romanians from other provinces, outraged the nationalist newspaperman Alexandru \"Ion Gorun\" Hodo\u0219, who wrote that Arbore was no longer sincerely interested in national unity, but rather displayed \"the need to detect, under any Romanian uniform, an assassin of Bessarabia's population.\" Arbore's main research on Bessarabian history and local geography fused scientific and political objectives. Allegedly inspired by the similar interests of \u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus, \"Dic\u021bionar geografic al Basarabiei\" was the first-ever actual Bessarabian gazetteer. In his two works on Bessarabia, Arbore sought to present a detailed account of economic and social geography. He notably inventoried the villages originally settled by free peasants (\"r\u0103ze\u0219i\"), accounting for 151 such localities in central Bessarabia and 4 in the Budjak. Overall, the politicized aspect of his contribution also had negative connotations. According to literary critic Bogdan Cre\u021bu (who builds on the conclusions of literary historian Leonte Ivanov), Arbore was also responsible for circulating a stereotyped image of the Russian Empire and its inhabitants. Before 1914, Arbore made accusatory claims about Russification and the Russian Orthodox Church expansion into Bessarabia: depicting the Russian Synod as a heretical, non-Orthodox, institution, he argued that church officials were burning Romanian books for heating.",
        "Political and scientific theories.:Germanophilia and Russophobia. Arbore's wartime stance, in particular his conjectural support for the Central Powers, was likened by Lucian Boia to that of fellow Bessarabian Constantin Stere, with the exception that Arbore was more the political radical, opposed to Tsarist autocracy, than a nationalist or Russophobe. However, as early as 1912, Arbore was envisaging a general rising against Russia, also involving the Poles and the Finns. In \"Autonomia sau anexarea\", he claimed that \"damned Russia\" secretly wanted to lure Romania into her war with the Austro-Hungarian provinces inhabited by Romanians, and in exchange expand its own territory southwards, into the Danube Delta and Dobruja. Arbore therefore saw the Transylvanian union as a hopeless project; his consolation for Romanians, Transylvanian as well as Bukovinian, was in the federalization of Austria-Hungary. Later, he claimed that his beliefs on the Transylvanian issue were quite similar to the skeptical Habsburg loyalism of Transylvanian politicos, from Eugen Brote and Ioan Slavici to Aurel Popovici. The articles he contributed to \"Seara\" noted with surprise that the pro-Entente Francophiles were more interested in rescuing France than they were in the fate of Bessarabian Romanians. \"Liberarea Basarabiei\", Marcel Mitra\u0219c\u0103 argues, was one of the select few manifestations of Romanian national sentiment to advocate Bessarabian emancipation at the peak of wartime agitation, alongside similar manifestos by Stere, Axinte Frunz\u0103, Dumitru C. Moruzi etc. Arbore's political theory was later expanded into a Germanophile manifesto: Arbore claimed that Romania's only option was to rally with \"Russia's enemies\" on the Eastern Front, limiting European Russia to the \"ethnographic\" borders of ancient Muscovy; the alternative, he warned, was that the \"musc\u0103lime\" (\"Moskals\") would in the long run annex Romania and all her irredenta. Again, he described the Romanian prospects of \"liberating Bessarabia\" as intrinsically linked with the German-sponsored emancipation of Congress Poland, the Grand Duchy of Finland and the Ukraine. In an August 1915 piece for \"Seara\", Arbore saluted the German people as the more \"enlightened\" combatant, who had accumulated a \"colossal vital energy\" and was therefore poised to emerge as the victor. With \"Ukraina \u0219i Rom\u00e2nia\", Zamfir Arbore spoke out against the opinions expressed by Romanian nationalist historian Nicolae Iorga, a leading figure in pro-Entente politics, who had denied the existence of a distinct Ukrainian identity. In fact, Arbore argued, the cultural separation between Ukrainians and Russians was both justified by history and opportune for the Romanian cause: since the Russian Empire could not hope to become a federation, and an independent Ukraine was therefore inevitable, \"the Ukrainian state would be a peaceful neighbor to Greater Romania.\" According to Lucian Boia, Arbore's public stances under the actual German occupation were surprisingly toned down. His one article for \"Lumina\" (November 1917) reviewed the Russian issue in quite different terms, prophesying that a multinational federation could be effected around the Russian Provisional Government. His 1918 public lectures on Bessarabia were focused on geographic and statistical information\u2014\"one would have expected more\", Boia notes. Arbore was more outspoken during the interwar period: his December 1918 speech demanded the guarantee of minority rights in Greater Romania, saluted the policies of Soviet Russia as a liberating force, and predicted a Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War. On the occasion, Arbore also demanded the release of Socialist Party activists held in Romanian custody, as well as the freeing of Transylvanian collaborationist Slavici.",
        "Legacy.",
        "Legacy.:Impact in academia. As both a historical figure and a historian, Zamfir Arbore received mixed reviews from other academics. His \"Via\u021ba Basarabiei\" partner Pan Halippa noted that Arbore's historical but minor merit in opposing \"Russification\" was equivalent to that of other Bessarabian boyars and writers from various epochs: Stere, Alecu Donici, Alexandru H\u00e2jdeu, Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu and Constantin Stamati. Although an ideological adversary of Arbore, Nicolae Iorga similarly referred to his Bessarabian colleague as a pioneer of Romanian Bessarabian activism. Sociologist Henri H. Stahl focused instead on Arbore's contributions as a scientist. Stahl discusses him and Stere, alongside theorist Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea and Nicolae Zubcu-Codreanu, as one of the most important intellectuals in the group of ex-Narodniks who contributed to the left-wing school of social sciences in Romania. He notes that Arbore stood apart in this group for his anarchist ideals, uncommon in his adoptive Romania. Contrarily, historian Cyril E. Black assessed that, unlike Stere's post-Narodnik theory of \"Poporanism\", Arbore's influence in Romanian politics was \"negligible\". A more controversial aspect of Arbore's legacy is an enduring accusation of plagiarism: his works are alleged to have borrowed the research of various other authors, to whom Arbore did not give proper credit. As early as 1879, Dobrogeanu-Gherea circulated some of Arbore's reminiscences of revolutionary life, quoted as excerpts in his own essays. One of the earliest historiographic works to trace Arbore's lifelong socialist militancy was authored shortly before its subject died, in 1933. Authored by I. C. Atanasiu, it was titled \"Mi\u0219carea socialist\u0103\" (\"The Socialist Movement\"). The same year, an account of his activities in Geneva was published as part of Pavel Axelrod's book of memoirs. A monograph on Arbore's life and work was published in 1936 by social scientist Alexandru Siedel.",
        "Legacy.:The Arbores and communist censorship. From her adoptive Soviet Union, Arbore's older daughter Ecaterina cultivated her father's image: in 1931, she helped publish fragments of his memoirs on Mikhail Bakunin and Sergey Nechayev, translated into Russian and signed with the abridged name \"Z. K. Ralli\". Noted for her medical work and political standing, Ecaterina was nevertheless labeled an enemy of the Soviet people, arrested and killed during the Great Purge of the late 1930s. As an author, Zamfir Arbore was somewhat tolerated in the Soviet Union and its Moldavian SSR, created in 1940 by the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia. In the late 1940s, his name was included on a long list of authors officially banned by the Soviet censorship apparatus. However, in later years he was officially quoted and praised, one of the few exceptions to the rule which put limits on the popularization of Romanian literature (unlike Stere, whose work were still banned). In Romania, Arbore was survived by daughter Nina (d. 1942). Known as the Romanian student of Henri Matisse, she maintained an interest in moderate leftist causes, joining the group formed around \"Cuv\u00e2ntul Liber\" newspaper. Her nephew Zamfir Dumitru Arbore fought against Nazi Germany in World War II, receiving \"Steaua Rom\u00e2niei\". In postwar Communist Romania, Zamfir Dumitru Arbore worked as a state planner, and established a family: his successors were still living at the family home in Bucharest in the early 1970s. The Arbores' patriarch was being rediscovered as a scholar, in particular after the 1960s liberalization (when Ecaterina was posthumously rehabilitated). Communist censorship however intervened in his various republished texts, cutting out all remarks which could seem Russophobic, keeping his political writings hidden from public view while allowing some exposure to his geography tracts. Among the anti-communist Romanian diaspora, genealogist Mihai Dim. Sturdza completed a more thorough account of Arbore's career, which covered the controversial aspects and was published in Sturdza's dictionary \"Familiile boiere\u0219ti din Moldova \u0219i \u021aara Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103\" (\"Boyar Families of Wallachia and Moldavia\"). Armand Go\u0219u noted that the entry comprised \"the best pages ever written on Zamfir Arbore\", while Ioan Stanomir sees in it a real-life equivalent of Fyodor Dostoevsky's \"The Possessed\" and Joseph Conrad's \"Under Western Eyes\". During the 1960s, the exiled journalist Pamfil \u0218eicaru also included ample references to Arbore's anti-Russian texts in his own anti-communist propaganda works. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Arbore's name resurfaced in a nationalist conspiracy theory, which claims that Mihai Eminescu's descent into mental illness was staged by his more conservative political rivals. According to this interpretation, the involuntary commitment of Eminescu in summer 1883 was set to coincide with the expulsion of his friend Arbore.",
        "Legacy.:In Moldova and abroad. Arbore's works were reprinted in Moldova, the independent post-Soviet republic comprising the bulk of historical Bessarabia. Moldovan literary historians Ion Varta and Tatiana Varta oversaw the 2001 reprint of \"Basarabia \u00een secolul XIX\"; the same year, Editura Funda\u021biei Culturale Rom\u00e2ne and Editura Museum co-edited his \"Dic\u021bionar geografic al Basarabiei\", with Iurie Colesnic as caretaker. His name was assigned to streets in both Chi\u0219in\u0103u and Bucharest. His Dolna manor is preserved as a museum. Arbore's contribution also made an impact outside its immediate cultural context. His memoirs were reviewed early on by anarchist historian Max Nettlau, who called them inaccurate, without specifying to what extent. Later, the various writings of Arbore-Ralli were studied, translated and preserved by exile Marxists Boris Nicolaevsky and Egor E. Lazarev, and passed on to the Hoover Institution. Writing in 1994, American historian Keith Hitchins reviewed \"Basarabia \u00een secolul XIX\" as \"an old, in some ways classic\" and \"still useful\" Romanian study of the Bessarabian question. Arbore's 2009 biography at the anarchist Kate Sharpley Library focuses on his revolutionary career rather than his other commitments, claiming that the Romanian reviews of his nationalist policies, beginning with Nicolae Iorga's texts, are \"mystification\", and noting that his activities in Greater Romania \"remain to be investigated\". According to the same source, an English translation of \"Temni\ufffd\ufffd\u0103 \u0219i exil\" was in progress, and considered for publication with Canada's Black Cat Press.",
