      "original-output": "Besides statins, there are several other types of medications that can be used to lower cholesterol:\n\n1. **Bile Acid Sequestrants**: These drugs work by binding to bile acids in the intestine, which prompts the liver to use excess cholesterol to produce more bile acids, thus lowering the cholesterol level in the blood. Examples include cholestyramine, colestipol, and colesevelam.\n\n2. **Ezetimibe**: This medication works by reducing the absorption of cholesterol in the small intestine. It can be used alone or in combination with statins.\n\n3. **PCSK9 Inhibitors**: These are injectable medications that help the liver absorb more LDL cholesterol, which reduces the amount of cholesterol circulating in the blood. Examples include alirocumab and evolocumab.\n\n4. **Niacin (Nicotinic Acid)**: Niacin can lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides while raising HDL cholesterol. However, its use is less common due to potential side effects.\n\n5. **Fibrates**: These are primarily used to lower triglycerides and can also help increase HDL cholesterol. Examples include gemfibrozil and fenofibrate.\n\n6. **Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplements**: These can help lower triglycerides and have other heart health benefits.\n\n7. **Bempedoic Acid**: This is a newer medication that works by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in the liver.\n\nEach of these medications works differently, and the choice of medication will depend on individual health needs, cholesterol levels, and any underlying conditions. It's important to consult a healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan for managing cholesterol.",
