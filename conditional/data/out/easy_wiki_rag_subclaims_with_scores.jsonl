Howard depends on how you define \"scope.\" If you consider scope in terms of influence and genre diversification, both authors have notable contributions, but they differ in areas.\n\n**Robert E. Howard:**\n- Howard is best known for his creation of Conan the Barbarian and is credited with being the father of the sword and sorcery subgenre. His works have had a significant influence on fantasy fiction, comparable to J.R.R. Tolkien's influence on high fantasy.\n- Howard's writing spanned several genres, including adventure, horror, and historical fiction, although he is primarily remembered for his fantasy works.\n- His influence has persisted well beyond his lifetime, and his characters have become iconic figures in popular culture.\n\n**Richard Ford:**\n- Richard Ford is an acclaimed American novelist and short story writer, known for his detailed exploration of the American experience through his works. His most famous series includes \"The Sportswriter\" and its sequels, which are highly regarded in literary circles.\n- Ford has won several prestigious awards, including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, indicating significant recognition within literary fiction.\n- His works tend to focus more on literary realism and character-driven narratives, which contrast with Howard's more genre-focused and fantastical stories.\n\nIn summary, Robert E. Howard has a broader influence in the realm of genre fiction, especially fantasy, with enduring cultural impact. Richard Ford, on the other hand, is more recognized for his contributions to literary fiction and character studies. The \"scope\" could be seen as broader for Howard in terms of genre impact and cultural imprint, whereas Ford's scope is notable in the literary fiction landscape.",
