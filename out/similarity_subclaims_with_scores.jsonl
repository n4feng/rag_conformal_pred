Howard:**\n- Known as the father of the sword and sorcery subgenre, Howard created the iconic character Conan the Barbarian, which has left a significant mark on popular culture.\n- Howard's work has influenced many later writers and has a lasting legacy in the fantasy fiction genre, rivaled only by figures like J.R.R. Tolkien.\n- Despite not being commercially successful during his lifetime, Howard's work has gained critical acclaim posthumously, with numerous scholarly works dedicated to his legacy.\n- He wrote across a diverse range of genres, including historical fiction and adventure tales.\n\n**Richard Ford:**\n- Ford is an acclaimed American novelist and short story writer, best known for his novel \"The Sportswriter\" and its sequels, which have been celebrated for their exploration of American life and existential themes.\n- He has received several literary awards and his works are widely anthologized, contributing to his reputation as a significant figure in contemporary American literature.\n\nIn terms of \"scope of profession,\" both authors have made significant contributions to literature, but in different ways. Howard's influence is particularly strong in the genre of fantasy, with a lasting impact on both literature and popular culture. Ford, on the other hand, excels in literary fiction, particularly with his exploration of American life and existential themes. \n\nThe \"scope\" ultimately depends on the context: Howard has a broader influence in genre fiction and pop culture, while Ford has a more focused impact within literary circles.",
