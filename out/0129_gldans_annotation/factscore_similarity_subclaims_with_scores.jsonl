She followed this success with a starring role in the film \"The Seven Minutes\" and appeared in popular TV shows such as \"Hawaii 5-0,\" \"Mannix,\" \"Cannon,\" and \"Love, American Style.\" \n\nIn 1968, McAndrew married actor Stewart Moss, and they starred together in the film \"The Bat People\" six years later. Although \"The Bat People\" was not well-received, it remains known as a \"bad film,\" and it was her last film released in theaters. Since then, she has focused on television, with a notable role as Doris Williams in the TV film \"Growing Up Brady.\"\n\nMcAndrew's work in \"Hello, Dolly!\" experienced a resurgence in popularity with the release of the film \"WALL-E,\" which featured clips from \"Hello, Dolly!\" including a duet with her character. Although she did not do her own singing in the film, the movie brought renewed attention to her role. \n\nIn her personal life, McAndrew has two brothers.",

            "original-output": "Sir Lees Knowles, 1st Baronet (16 February 1857 \u2013 7 October 1928), was a notable British barrister, military historian, and Conservative politician. He was born to John Knowles and Elizabeth Lees in Oldham, Lancashire, where his family owned the Andrew Knowles and Sons collieries. Educated at Rugby School and Trinity College, Cambridge, Lees was a distinguished athlete and served as the president of the Cambridge University Athletics Club. He studied law and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1882.\n\nKnowles had a keen interest in military history, authoring several books on Napoleon's life. In 1912, he endowed the Lees Knowles Lectureship at Trinity College, an annual series focusing on military science. His political career included serving as the Member of Parliament for Salford West after the 1886 general election. He held roles such as parliamentary secretary to Charles Ritchie and was the Second Church Estates Commissioner from 1896 to 1906. He was made a baronet in 1903 but lost his parliamentary seat in 1906.\n\nHis military involvement included serving as an officer in the Volunteer Force and later in the Territorial Force, where he achieved the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Knowles commanded several battalions of the Lancashire Fusiliers and was vice-chairman of the Lancashire Territorial Army Association.\n\nAs a philanthropist, Knowles supported various charities, most notably the Guinness Trust for Housing the Poor. In his honor, two roads in Llandudno, North Wales, are named Lees Road and Knowles Road. He passed away in October 1928 at his home in Westwood, Pendlebury, at the age of 71.",

His initial training in engraving was under Dom Robart, a monk at the priory of St. Peter in Abbeville. He later moved to Paris, where he furthered his skills with the guidance of Robert Hecquet, another engraver from his hometown.\n\nDaull\u00e9's talent quickly garnered attention, leading to his acceptance into the Academy in 1742. Throughout his career, he became known for his detailed engravings of portraits and historical subjects, executed with a clear and firm style. He often signed his works with the initials \"J. D.\"\n\nHe was a friend of the portrait artist Donat Nonnotte and engraved several of Nonnotte's paintings. After his death on April 23, 1763, in Paris, his widow published some of his engravings as a collection titled 'OEuvre.' Jean Daull\u00e9's works remain well-regarded, and his contributions are documented in Deligni\u00e8re's \"Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 de l'oeuvre grav\u00e9 de Jean Daull\u00e9 d'Abbeville,\" published in 1872.",

            "original-output": "Miguel \u00c1ngel D\u00edaz, born on November 28, 1994, is a Dominican professional baseball pitcher. He currently plays for the San Diego Padres in Major League Baseball (MLB). D\u00edaz began his professional career by signing with the Milwaukee Brewers as an international free agent in 2011. He initially played in the Dominican Summer League and later moved to the rookie-level Arizona League for the 2014 and 2015 seasons. \n\nIn 2016, D\u00edaz played in the Class-A Midwest League with the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers, both as a starter and a reliever. He was selected by the Minnesota Twins in the first round of the 2016 Rule 5 draft and was subsequently traded to the San Diego Padres. D\u00edaz made his MLB debut with the Padres on Opening Day in 2017. Initially used as a reliever, he transitioned to a starter role in June of that year but suffered a forearm strain, which put him on the disabled list. He finished the 2017 season with 33 strikeouts in 41 innings and a 7.34 ERA.\n\nIn 2018, the Padres aimed to develop D\u00edaz as a starter, assigning him to their minor league affiliates, including the Double-A San Antonio Missions and Triple-A El Paso. He returned to the Padres' major league team briefly during the season and continued to work primarily as a reliever. He ended the season with a 4.82 ERA in 18 innings in the major leagues and showed promising performance in the minors, with a 2.35 ERA in 65 innings at San Antonio. After the season, D\u00edaz participated in the Arizona Fall League to further hone his skills.",

            "original-output": "Jesse William Foppert, born on July 10, 1980, is an American former Major League Baseball pitcher. He attended San Rafael High School, where he excelled as a two-time all-MCAL player in the position of shortstop. Foppert continued his baseball career at the University of San Francisco, achieving an 8\u20134 record with a 3.75 ERA in 16 games during the 2001 season. \n\nHe was selected by the San Francisco Giants in the second round (74th overall) of the 2001 Major League Baseball Draft. Foppert quickly rose through the Giants' minor league system, splitting a season between Double A Shreveport and Triple A Fresno, leading all Giants minor leaguers with 183 strikeouts, and earning the title of the Giants minor league player of the year.\n\nFoppert made his MLB debut with the Giants in 2003, joining the starting rotation and earning his first major league win on May 3 against the Cincinnati Reds. However, his progress was hampered by an elbow injury in August 2003, which led to Tommy John surgery. Despite the setback, Foppert continued to play, though his subsequent career involved trades and minor league stints. In 2005, he was traded to the Seattle Mariners, and he spent the remainder of the season pitching for their Triple A team, the Tacoma Rainiers.\n\nFoppert attempted to return to the Giants in 2007 after being released by the Mariners, but ultimately became a free agent and re-signed with the Giants, only to be released again in June. His career was marked by early promise but was ultimately affected by injuries.",

            "original-output": "Zelma Wilson (born Zelma Gussin on November 23, 1918, in New York City) was a notable American architect primarily active in California. She was the daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants and grew up in Santa Paula, California. Her mother, Rose, was a shopkeeper, and her stepfather was Ed Kraus. Wilson graduated from Santa Paula Union High School and pursued art at the University of California, Berkeley, later studying at the California Institute of Technology. She was the only woman in her graduating class at the USC School of Architecture in 1947.\n\nWilson married screenwriter Michael Wilson in 1941, with whom she had two daughters. The couple were members of the American Communist Party from 1938 until 1956. The Hollywood blacklist impacted their lives, prompting them to move to France in 1952 where Zelma studied sculpture at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. She earned her architecture license in 1957 and worked with prominent architects such as Richard Neutra and Rudolph Schindler.\n\nIn 1964, the Wilsons settled in Ojai, California, where Zelma opened her architectural firm, Zelma Wilson and Associates, AIA, in 1967. Her work primarily focused on community buildings, including schools, churches, and libraries, as well as private residences and other structures. In 1977, she served as president of the Ventura County branch of the AIA and was named a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1983.\n\nZelma Wilson was widowed in 1978 and later received her husband's posthumous Academy Award in 1985. She passed away on May 10, 1996, shortly before she was to be honored by the Ojai Film Society. Her professional papers are archived at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg.",

            "original-output": "Prince Rivers (1824\u20131887) was a notable African-American figure who played a significant role during the American Civil War and the Reconstruction era. Born into slavery in Beaufort, South Carolina, Rivers worked on the Oak Point plantation owned by Henry Middleton Stuart, Sr. He served as a carriage driver and household staff, positions that were among the elite of the estate's enslaved people. During his time there, he learned to read and write.\n\nIn 1862, Rivers escaped slavery by stealing a horse and crossing Confederate lines to reach Union-occupied Beaufort. He volunteered to join the Union Army and became a sergeant in the 1st South Carolina Volunteers, a regiment in the United States Colored Troops. Although his commanding officer, Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson, sought to promote him to a commissioned rank, Rivers' race prevented this advancement.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Rivers returned to the Edgefield District in South Carolina and settled near Hamburg, a thriving black-majority town. He became active in the Republican Party and was involved in state politics during Reconstruction. In 1867, he served as a registrar for Edgefield County and was a delegate to the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1868. He was also one of three African-American founders of Aiken County in 1871.\n\nRivers held various public offices, including state legislator, trial judge, mayor, county coroner, and justice of the peace. He was known for his oratory skills and contributions to the community as an essayist and politician. Despite the challenges of his time, Rivers' life and career were marked by his commitment to public service and the advancement of African-American rights during Reconstruction.",

            "original-output": "Rennie Fritchie, Baroness Fritchie, born Irene Tordoff Fennell on April 29, 1942, in Fife, Scotland, is a distinguished British civil servant. Known for her significant contributions to public service and gender equality, she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1996 New Year Honours. In 2005, she was granted a life peerage, becoming Baroness Fritchie of Gloucester, and sits as a crossbencher in the House of Lords.\n\nIn her career, Baroness Fritchie was a pioneer in women's training, serving as one of the first full-time women's training advisers in the 1970s. She played a pivotal role in the training of staff at the Equal Opportunities Commission. Her work in gender equality was further bolstered by a German Marshall Fellowship in 1985, which allowed her to draw valuable insights from the United States for improving the status of women in the UK.\n\nBaroness Fritchie has held numerous roles outside government, including an honorary Professorship in Creative Leadership at York University and the position of Pro-Chancellor at Southampton University. She has also been involved with several charities and has received honorary degrees from various academic institutions.\n\nBaroness Fritchie married Don Jamie Fritchie in 1960, with whom she had two children. Sadly, she was widowed in 1992 following the death of her husband and had previously lost her elder child in 1991. Her dedication to public service continued throughout these personal challenges, and she has been a Commissioner for Public Appointments since 1999, with her appointment being renewed in 2002 and 2005. In 2010, she further expanded her leadership roles by becoming Chairman of Nominet.",

            "original-output": "Zamfir Arbore, born Zamfir Constantin Arbore (originally Zamfir Ralli) on November 14, 1848, in what was then Bukovina, was a noted Romanian political activist, historian, geographer, and ethnographer. He was of mixed heritage, with Romanian, Greek, and Ukrainian roots, and he changed his last name to Arbore in homage to an ancient Romanian boyar family, although the legitimacy of this claim is debated by historians.\n\nArbore was deeply involved in the Russian revolutionary movement, participating in nihilist and Narodnik conspiracies. He eventually self-exiled to Switzerland, where he joined the International Workingmen's Association and became an international anarchist, influenced by Mikhail Bakunin. After parting with Bakunin, he formed his own group, the Revolutionary Community, and later collaborated with the anarchist geographer \u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus.\n\nAfter 1877, Arbore moved to Romania, where he distanced himself from anarchism and embraced socialism. He campaigned against Russian despotism and advocated for the freedom of Bessarabia, a region with personal significance due to his family history. In Romania, he became a cultural journalist and established connections with socialist and National Liberal activists. He was also a friend of poet Mihai Eminescu and worked with writer Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu.\n\nDuring World War I, Arbore controversially supported a Romanian alliance with the Central Powers to liberate Bessarabia, but he later welcomed the October Revolution. He reintegrated into Romanian politics, serving two terms in the Senate and aligning with agrarian and cooperativist politics. He was a member of the Peasants' Party and the People's Party.\n\nZamfir Arbore's contributions extended to academia and literature, with detailed works on Bessarabian geography and collected memoirs. He retired from teaching in 1930 and continued to contribute sporadically to publications until his death on April 2 or 3, 1933. He left behind a legacy through his daughters, Ecaterina, a communist politician and physician, and Nina, a modern artist.",
